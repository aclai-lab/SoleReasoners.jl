# SoleReasoners

## Introduction

Welcome to the documentation for [SoleReasoners](https://github.com/aclai-lab/SoleReasoners.jl/), a Julia package for [automated reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_reasoning) up to Many-Valued Multi-Modal Logic built on top of [SoleLogics](https://github.com/aclai-lab/SoleLogics.jl/) and part of [Sole.jl](https://github.com/aclai-lab/Sole.jl), an open-source framework for symbolic machine learning.

## Installation

To install SoleReasoners.jl, use the Julia package manager:
```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("SoleReasoners")
```

## Feature Summary

SoleReasoners.jl provides a [SAT solver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAT_solver) and an [automated theorem prover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_theorem_proving) up to Many-Valued Multi-Modal Logic based on the [method of analytic tableau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_analytic_tableaux).

## About

The package is developed by the [ACLAI Lab](https://aclai.unife.it/en/) @ University of Ferrara.
